        "# Theory Question\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages like Python execute code line by line, while\n",
        "  - Compiled languages like C++ translate code to machine language before execution, resulting in faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage errors in your program using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The finally block ensures that important code, such as file closing or cleanup, runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging helps track events that happen when software runs.\n",
        "    > It is useful for debugging, auditing, and running diagnostics.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method is a destructor in Python, automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - 'import' loads the whole module, while\n",
        "  - 'from module import' loads specific attributes or functions from a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - You can handle multiple exceptions by grouping them in a tuple within one except clause.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The 'with' statement simplifies exception handling in file operations by ensuring that files are properly closed after their suite finishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading runs multiple threads in one process, sharing memory.\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing runs separate processes with separate memory, suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Logging makes it easier to trace bugs and understand the application's behavior without disrupting program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Python manages memory using reference counting and garbage collection, freeing memory automatically when objects are no longer used.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Python handles exceptions in the order:\n",
        "    try (run code) -> except (handle errors) -> else (run if no error) -> finally (always runs).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Good memory management ensures :\n",
        "    > efficient use of system resources and\n",
        "    > prevents crashes or slow performance due to memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - These keywords are used to catch and handle exceptions, preventing abrupt program termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python's garbage collector automatically reclaims unused memory by removing objects no longer referenced.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The else block in exception handling runs only when no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging levels include :\n",
        "    > DEBUG (detailed info),\n",
        "    > INFO (confirmation),\n",
        "    > WARNING (potential issues),\n",
        "    > ERROR (serious problems), and\n",
        "    > CRITICAL (very serious errors).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - os.fork creates a child process (Unix only), while\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing works on all platforms and is more flexible and safer in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - It is important to close a file after use to release system resources and avoid data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - file.read() reads the entire file, while\n",
        "  - file.readline() reads one line at a time, which is more memory-efficient for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - The logging module provides flexible ways to record log messages to files, streams, or other outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - The os module provides a way to interact with the operating system, such as file and directory operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Python's memory management can struggle with circular references and may lead to memory leaks in poorly written code.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - Custom exceptions can be raised using the 'raise' keyword to signal an error condition explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Multithreading is useful for I/O-bound applications, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently and improving responsiveness.\n",
